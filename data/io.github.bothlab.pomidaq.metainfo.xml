    <p>
      PoMiDAQ is a recording software for UCLA Miniscopes for neuroscientific research.
      It is designed to work with the latest OpenCV libraries and provides a shared library,
      so Miniscope recording features can easily be embedded into other programs and pipelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recorded data is encoded with the FFV1 codec by default, to allow for smaller, lossless video files that are safe to archive.
